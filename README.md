## Overview

This project examines:
- Global skin cancer trends  
- U.S. health behavior patterns related to skin cancer  
- Tumor characteristics (benign vs. malignant)

Methods used:
- Correlation analysis  
- Mann–Whitney U test  
- Chi-Square Test of Independence  
- One-Way ANOVA  
- Data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory analysis  

Key insights:
- **Age** is strongly associated with skin cancer presence  
- **Tumor smoothness** significantly differentiates benign vs. malignant tumors  
- Health behavior variables show mixed relationships
